                <p class="blurb">The perfect recipe for crispy Cantonese style roasted pork belly.</p>
                <div class="main-article-image"><img src="images/cantonese-roast-pork-belly.jpg"
                        alt="sliced roasted pork belly on a platter"></div>
                <p>Growing up, dinner time was always special at my home. My parents worked long hours. And I was always
                    somewhere else getting into trouble. But despite our busy schedules, my parents made it a point to
                    always eat dinner together. They specialized in traditional Cantonese cuisine and I have fond
                    memories of many dishes, but Siu Yuk was by far my favourite.</p>

                <p>The most important element of great Siu Yuk is a nice and crispy skin. The key to a nice crackling
                    and flaking is to pierce the pork belly skin. The first thing we need to do is blanche the pork
                    belly. Submerge the pork belling in boiling water for 10-15 minutes then remove and place it skin
                    side up on a cutting board. Next, take a small fork and poke as many holes as you can into the skin.
                    You want to be sure to pierce them as deep as possible without going through the skin. The more
                    holes you make the flakier your skin will be. Piercing the skin helps release the oils and moisture
                    allowing it to crisp up very nicely.</p>
                <div class="main-article-image"><img src="images/roast-pork-belly-2.jpg"
                        alt="pork belly in aluminum foil container"></div>
                <p>Once you're done pricking the skin, take a paper towel to wipe off any excess water that builds up.
                    Then generously sprinkle salt and rub it into the skin. After 30 minutes wipe any excess liquid and
                    salt away, and place the pork belly skin side up in a shallow container of marinade. The marinade
                    should come up the sides of the container covering the meat of the pork belly but not touching the
                    skin. If you have trouble finding an appropriate container you can make one out of aluminum foil we
                    will be needing one later anyways. Leave the container in the fridge overnight uncovered. This will
                    let the skin dry even further while letting the pork belly soak up all that delicious marinade.</p>
                <div class="main-article-image"><img src="images/cantonese-roast-pork-belly-1.jpg"
                        alt="served roasted pork belly"></div>
                <p>All thats left to do now is put it in the oven. If you haven't yet, take a large piece of aluminum
                    foil and fold up the sides around the pork belly snugly, almost like you're making a box. This helps
                    protect the meat from the high heat. Preheat the oven and brush the skin with some rice wine
                    vinegar. Then place the pork belly in the center of the oven and roast for an 1 hour and 45 minutes.
                    Take the pork belly out of the oven and turn the broiler to low. Put the pork belly into the lowest
                    tray as far from the heat source as possible. After 10-15 minutes remove when the skin has puffed
                    nice and crispy.</p>
