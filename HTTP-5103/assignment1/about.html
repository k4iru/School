    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Kyle Cheung</h2>
    <p>My passion for building started at a young age when I was gifted my first Lego set.
        I'd spend hours in my bedroom putting blocks together to build robots and whatever else I could think of.
        Programming, similarly is about taking fundamental concepts and adding those blocks together. Everything starts
        with the basics, which is why I enjoy experimenting with as many things as possible and expanding my breadth of
        knowledge.</p>
    <h2>Website Experiences</h2>
    <p>
        I have quite a lot of experience in using the internet and using various websites. From a young age, I would
        spend a lot of my time on things like
        newgrounds playing flash games. As I've grown older I've moved on to using it as a resource for improving
        myself. Through sites like youtube, it's possible
        to learn almost anything you want from just a quick search.
