    <p><em>Moist and delicious banana bread recipe. Easy to make, no need for a mixer!<br \> Ripe bananas, butter,
            sugar, egg, vanilla, baking soda, and flour.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>

        No need for a mixer for this recipe! Clean-up is easy too, if you want, <strong>you can mix everything in one
            mixing bowl</strong>.

        The best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are <em>over-ripe</em>. The yellow peels should be at
        least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.

            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <hr />
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
                the mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), or until a
                tester inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan
                and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't
                crumbly.)</li>
        </ol>
